# agda-devcontainer

A simple vscode dev container with the Agda standard library to enable you to get started with Agda quickly.

Thanks to @brando90 for the idea, have published a built docker image so you don't have to build it yourself from scratch at https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/johnryan465/agda-devcontainer.
